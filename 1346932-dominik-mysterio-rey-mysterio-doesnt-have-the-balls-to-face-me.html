Rey and Dominik became the first father-son duo in WWE history to win tag team titles at WrestleMania Backlash 2021. Dominik later turned on Rey at WWE Clash at the Castle 2022 and joined the Judgment Day. He and his father have been at odds ever since. Dominik has repeatedly tried to provoke his father into a match, but Rey has not given in.</p><p>Speaking with Alex McCarthy for <a href=#>Inside The Ropes</a>, Dominik was asked whether he wants to battle his father in a match. Dominik noted that while he has expressed his reluctance in the past, now he’s ready to take him on. However, he shared his belief that he doesn’t think Rey wants to face him. Dominik stated that Rey doesn’t have the “balls”, and he doesn’t think his father can hang with him.</p><p>“I did interviews in the past and I always said that I never wanted to wrestle my dad, just because what he’s done for me, this and that,” Dominik said. “I get that, but I don’t think he wants to get in there with me, to be honest. I think it’s gotten to the point where I’ve shown that I’m willing to do what it takes to take him out and to prove that I’m the only Mysterio that matters in this business, at the end of the day.</p><p>“He’s done, like Damian said, he’s washed, and I just really don’t think that he wants to be in there with me. Not only because I don’t think he has the balls to, but just more of the fact that he understands that he can’t hang in there with me. At the end of the day, it’s on him. I’ve proved my point. I’ve been in there, provoked him multiple times, but he’s not taking the bait, so I don’t see it happening. But if it does, it’s gonna be on him.”</p><p>McCarthy compared the father-son feud to that of The Undertaker and Kane, but Dominik described how they were different because of the dynamics of the relationship. He noted that Rey was willing to discipline him when he was a kid, but the situation has changed now that he’s all grown up.</p><p>“I don’t see him putting hands on me. That’s the thing,” Dominik said. “He was more than happy to do it when I was a kid, to discipline me and whatnot. But now as an adult, now that I’m five, six inches taller than him, he’s not willing to reciprocate that love anymore. So I don’t know. We’ll see, but I don’t think he has the balls to lay his hands on me.”</p><p>Dominik cost Rey his match against Karrion Kross on the February 24 episode of WWE SmackDown. He has also ruined multiple holidays for his father; most recently, <a href=#>Dominik crashed Rey’s Valentine’s Day dinner</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJtbXJrYmKxsLnIp6CkZZ2uwLWx0aKmZqqVrnquxdKtnKuhn2KxsLHSp6tmoJGrsm7Ax55km5mcocBuwM5mnZqblWK6pg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f1346932-dominik-mysterio-rey-mysterio-doesnt-have-the-balls-to-face-me.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f1346932-dominik-mysterio-rey-mysterio-doesnt-have-the-balls-to-face-me.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f1346932-dominik-mysterio-rey-mysterio-doesnt-have-the-balls-to-face-me.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f1346932-dominik-mysterio-rey-mysterio-doesnt-have-the-balls-to-face-me.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f1346932-dominik-mysterio-rey-mysterio-doesnt-have-the-balls-to-face-me.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f1346932-dominik-mysterio-rey-mysterio-doesnt-have-the-balls-to-face-me.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-king-movie-review-2019.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-king-movie-review-2019.html>The King movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-two-popes-movie-review-2019.html>The Two Popes movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-two-popes-movie-review-2019.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
