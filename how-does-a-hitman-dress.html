It's meant for them to look like birds, it plays in with why they wear all white, so that they look like eagles. That's kinda where the Eagle vision comes from, the main point of the Assassins is to be the, “birds of prey” kinda thing.<h2>Why do Assassins wear robes?</h2>There's also a practical reason for an Assassin to have some form of red cloth on them; if you're wearing crisp white robes, you can wipe your bloody weapons on that red sash to avoid stains.

Agent 47's tattoo is scanned and lets him through security checkpoints inside the facility where he was made.<h2>What kind of shoes does the hitman wear?</h2>47 wears a stainless Rolex Submariner with a black dial, possibly a 5513, throughout the film. 47's watch is best seen just before he's about to do some badass gun handling. Naturally, all of 47's accompanying attire is black; he wears black cap-toe derby shoes with black socks.<h2>Can you escape a hitman?</h2>A driver is required to immediately stop whenever there is an accident, even if the driver leaving the scene was not at fault or there was no damage or injury. This is the law in most states, including California. Leaving the scene of an accident (Hit and Run) can be charged as a misdemeanor or felony in California.<h2>What skills do Assassins need?</h2><p>Just wondering about the weapons used, skills and learning to be a fantasy assassin (like Rezkin from Kings Dark Tidings, or Hayden from the Riyria Revelations).
