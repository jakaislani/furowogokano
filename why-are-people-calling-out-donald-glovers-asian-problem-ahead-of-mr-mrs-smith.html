But with the <a href=#>upcoming release</a> of his Prime Video Mr. & Mrs. Smith reboot, some uncomfortable questions about his attitudes to Asian people, specifically Asian women, have been brought up once more, driven by the fact that his fictional wife and co-star is Maya Erskine, who is the half-Japanese.</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=141 data-injectable=false>So, just why are people calling out Donald Glover’s “Asian problem” ahead of Mr. & Mrs. Smith? We have the scoop below.</p><h2 id=h-anti-asian-and-fetishizing-themes-in-his-early-work data-injectable=false>Anti-Asian and fetishizing themes in his early work</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image1-51.jpg><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false>Let’s start at the beginning, specifically with his album Camp.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>The problems with some of his earlier lyrics are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">well documented</a>. Some of the worst lines include these from “Kids (Keep Up)”:</p><p>“Finding you is like finding Asians I hate// But they say I got a fetish, nah, I’m skipping all of it// Black or white girls come with a set of politics”</p><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=887 data-injectable=true>Then there’s the plethora of “Yellow Fever” staples, like reducing the women he raps about to nothing more than their race/ethnicity. Without the context of the rest of the album, some of these lines might be relatively innocuous. For example, “Chillin’ with a Filipina at your local Jollibee” from “Bonfire” seems like a harmless reference that was most likely put in for rhythmic reasons, but when it’s part of a larger whole, it’s a lot harder to ignore.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>The line “This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef” also appears in the same song, showing that it’s not just Asian women on Glover’s radar. Again, if this was the only line in the album it could be dismissed as an insensitive and poor attempt at getting a funny line in, but it isn’t the sole questionable lyric.</p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=859 data-injectable=true>With that said, his Childish Gambino rap persona was especially jokey in his earlier days, so a very generous interpretation of these bars might be that they are simply of their time, and not indicative of a wider lack of respect by Glover. This would kind of make sense, especially if you check out his stand up special Weird, which definitely strays into the cringey when watched through today’s sensibilities. However, there have been other strange comments that keep the argument alive.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bet he not even getting paid , they just said asian romantic interest and he hit the gym <a href=#>https://t.co/zx1HbowEkd</a></p>— IJusBeTalkin 🇳🇬 (@thelastnara) <a href=#>November 16, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>Then there was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that time</a> he created a weird Tumblr where he posed as a young Asian woman, which doesn’t help matters.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why is this “Asian problem” different to other criticisms of Donald Glover?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Donald-Glover-SNL-2018.jpg><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true>It’s hard to square this immature content with the guy behind the masterful, multi-faceted Because the Internet. But even his recent work hasn’t been free from criticism, with a fair few outlets and commentators accusing him of being anti-Black women. His last release prior to Mr & Mrs Smith has even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">been called “hate mail” in some well respected publications</a>.</p><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>This is something Glover clearly has thought about, shown most clearly by the fact he mentioned it in his surreal and somewhat pretentious <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 interview with himself</a>. He’s not been afraid to look at it in his art, either, as evidenced by a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">much scrutinized scene</a> in Atlanta in which a Black female character attacks a white woman for having a Black partner. Glover’s own partner is white, so it’s hard not to make personal comparisons, nor to make the leap that this is something that he has considered.</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>The sad thing is, this also shows that Glover clearly does have the tools and intelligence to look at racism in a complex way. He doesn’t seem to fall into the liberal trap of treating bigotry like a scoreboard, and has produced ideas that broadly align with an intersectional way of thinking. He is capable of addressing almost every elephant in the room <strong>—</strong> just not the Asian one.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Part of a wider culture</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mr.-and-Mrs.-Smith-Prime-Video-9.jpg><p data-characters=714 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true>This could be seen as part of a wider issue of anti-Asian racism within the African-American community. Of course, inter-minority bigotry isn’t exactly a new phenomenon, and when it comes down to it is less all-encompassing than the structural and institutionalized racism that mostly benefits privileged white folks in the West. Plus, white people still <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">overwhelmingly make up </a>the perpetrators of hate crimes against Asian people, and Black people <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">undoubtedly face the most racism in the U.S</a>, so when it comes to priorities, it isn’t quite the top of the list. But this specific form of racism within communities of color <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">does exist</a>, stoked by historical and cultural factors, and should be addressed.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>We have to do it carefully, though. Anti-Asian racism by Black people is a talking point of moral panic that Conservative outlets, some of whom are allegedly respected, have been baselessly pushing, to the extent that some publications have produced articles that literally <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">make up statistics</a> which they don’t offer direct sources to.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>Whether it’s tension between Korean Americans and Black Americans, Cuban-American Republicans disdaining Venezuelan immigrants, or Indians letting their Islamophobia show, we need to tackle this kind of bigotry as it infects solidarity movements. Whether he likes it or not, Glover is a part of that problem because of the lyrics he’s penned, and the jokes he’s made.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>So, should I watch Mr. & Mrs. Smith?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mr.-and-Mrs.-Smith-Prime-Video-11.jpg><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=859 data-injectable=true>Glover has also really slowed down on the fetishization, with his recent work being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more experimental</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">focused specifically</a> on Black issues than anything else. There was a tiny hint of his feelings towards Asian women in season 3 of Atlanta, which actually looked at the topic from a nuanced, yet ridiculous perspective: An Asian character makes a comment about how Black men tend to hit on her to a Black character, who takes it in good humor, only for a group of white saviors to end up attacking her for being racist. You can make of that what you will.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>Although this all shouldn’t be ignored, I also am certain that Erskine’s character will be a well-rounded one in Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Glover is a talented guy who understands how to make complex and interesting characters, including women (despite what some outlets say about Van from Atlanta), and it’s unlikely Erskine has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">been brought on </a>as a Phoebe Waller-Bridge replacement to be an empty shell.</p><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=false>Plus, the new Mr. & Mrs. Smith is likely to be a whole different beast to the original, which relied heavily on its intense sex appeal. Glover and Erskine are both known for their comedic talents, and it seems the series will be going down that route rather than relying on the chemistry between its co-stars, which in the Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie version practically oozes through the screen. In that sense, it seems Erskine wasn’t just hired because she’s good looking. In the context of all the above, we’ll take that as a win.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqcWMmqmeZaCavLG4xGaamqScnruoec6uq2acn6OurbCMoKOorpWnwG6t0qKYp2Wgp7yjuMSmZJqglZaxbrvFZqSrZZ2nwG6%2FzKKroWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-are-people-calling-out-donald-glovers-asian-problem-ahead-of-mr-mrs-smith.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-are-people-calling-out-donald-glovers-asian-problem-ahead-of-mr-mrs-smith.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-are-people-calling-out-donald-glovers-asian-problem-ahead-of-mr-mrs-smith.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-are-people-calling-out-donald-glovers-asian-problem-ahead-of-mr-mrs-smith.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-are-people-calling-out-donald-glovers-asian-problem-ahead-of-mr-mrs-smith.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-are-people-calling-out-donald-glovers-asian-problem-ahead-of-mr-mrs-smith.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-2011-macbook-air-11-13inch-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-2011-macbook-air-11-13inch-review.html>Battery Life - The 2011 MacBook Air (11 &amp;amp; 13-inch): Thoroughly Reviewed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./steve-martini-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Steve Martini Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./steve-martini-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
