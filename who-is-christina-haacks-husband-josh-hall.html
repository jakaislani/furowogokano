Among the most publicized highlights of their relationship is their grand <a href=#>move</a> to their new home in Newport Beach, California.</p><p>Via Instagram, the mother of three described the property as her longtime family home. Ultimately, the move made the family of five closer to their friends, work and even their kids’ school.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CeciZ9gFlEc/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=</p></figure><p>Along with the news, Haack posted photos showing glimpses of the house, her kids and her husband. Fans couldn’t but notice how happy the family looked in the shots, especially the lovebirds who are content to finally be married after their long road together.</p><p>While fans know enough about Christina Haack to understand her happiness was well-deserved, the same cannot be said about her husband, who isn’t as famous. In honor of their many years of marital bliss to come, here’s all we know about Josh Hall.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Christina_Haacks_Husband></span><strong>Who Is Christina Haack’s Husband?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Christina Haack’s husband</a> Josh Hall is a real estate realtor and former police officer. Per his website <a href=#>Spyglass Realty</a>, he joined the police force several years back, when he was only twenty-one.</p><p>However, his career as an officer ended untimely after he sustained multiple injuries on-the-job. Thereafter, Hall embraced real estate, making a sustainable career out of it. Thankfully, his previous career helped prepare him for his job as a real estate agent long before obtaining his Texas real estate license.</p><p>Additionally, Josh Hall is brother to reality stars Jessica Hall and Stacie Adams, who are nurturing careers in showbiz. Jessica has appeared on reality shows like “The Hills,” “Kendra,” and “Kendra On Top.”</p><p>Notably, her circle include Kendra Wilkinson from “The Girl Next Door,” and Heather Rae Young, now married to Haack’s ex-husband. Meanwhile, Stacie is known for her appearance as Stacie the bartender on two seasons of “The Hills.”</p><p>Aside from his real estate ventures, Josh Hall also co-owns production company Unbroken Productions, with his wife. The company would produce the upcoming fourth season of the HGTV show “Christina Of The Coast.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Cakg_AGv_uB/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Josh_Halls_Life_Before_Christina_Haack></span><strong>Josh Hall’s Life Before Christina Haack</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Before kicking off his romance with Christina Haack, Josh Hall was previously married to his former flame Chelsea Baker. Reports show the exes finalized their divorce sometime in 2021, with Hall moving out of their shared home that February.</p><p>While it is unclear why they split, sources claim Hall walked out of their marriage abruptly, leaving his ex-wife heartbroken.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Life_With_Christina_Haack></span><strong>Life With Christina Haack</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Christina Haack reportedly met her husband for the first time in 2010 during a real estate conference. They reconnected ten years later, in the spring of 2020, but managed to keep their affair secret until they went public in March 2021.</p><p>They became engaged in September that year, taking to Instagram to share their happy news. Barely seven months after their engagement, the two <a href=#>tied the knot</a>, with the television personality changing her name to Christina Hall.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CeE89nrOTbN/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Christina_Haacks_Husband_Supports_Her></span><strong>Christina Haack’s Husband Supports Her</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christina Haack and Her husband have certainly proved themselves the ideal couple goals with loved-up photos of them splashed across media platforms.</p><p>They have also taken their pact as life partners to greater heights by working together, both career-wise and as parents, and by standing by each other in good and bad times. And Hall has done just that these last months, amid the brewing battle between Christina Haack and former husband Ant Anstead over the custody of their 2-year-old son.</p><p>In one of his Instagram posts, the former officer <a href=#>vowed to support his wife and step-kids</a> in every way. He also promised to give the kids the best dad example to ensure they stay safe from unnecessary trauma.</p><p>In another post, the realtor <a href=#>defended</a> his wife, describing her as an incredible woman. He also slammed those attempting to weigh in on her ongoing custody battle, saying some things were better off left private.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Christina_Haacks_Exes></span><strong>Christina Haack’s Exes</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although she is now in a good place with Tarek, Haack lived through several failed <a href=#>relationships</a> in the past. These failed relationships included two marriages.</p><p>First, she married “Flip Or Flop” co-star Tarek El Moussa in April 2009. The duo went on to have two children, Taylor Reese El Moussa and Brayden James El Moussa before their divorce in 2016.</p><p>Next, Christina Haack married “Wheelers And Dealers” star Ant Anstead whom she began dating about ten months after split from El Moussa.

Hack and Anstead announced their separation in September 2020. Despite the onslaught of <a href=#>celebrity breakups</a> hitting the media at the time amid the coronavirus pandemic, their breakup came as a shock to many, especially as their son was barely a year old.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZpuYp7a0wMinmGagkZawrL%2BMoaysmpGjsW62zqyfZqCRoblw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-christina-haacks-husband-josh-hall.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-christina-haacks-husband-josh-hall.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-christina-haacks-husband-josh-hall.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-christina-haacks-husband-josh-hall.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-christina-haacks-husband-josh-hall.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-christina-haacks-husband-josh-hall.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./3-layer-fruit-smoothie.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./3-layer-fruit-smoothie.html>3-Layer Fruit Smoothie</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./transformers-rise-dark-spark-review.html>Transformers: Rise Of The Dark Spark Review</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./transformers-rise-dark-spark-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
