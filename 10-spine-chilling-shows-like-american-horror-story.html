Created by Sam Shaw and Dustin Thomason, the psychological horror series premiered on Hulu in 2018. Set in titular Castle Rock, Maine, the series follows a string of characters wrapped up in the realm of mythological darkness which intertwines with several stories.

Created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan, the enticing black comedy slasher series follows Kappa Kappa Tau, a college sorority house that finds its members targeted by an unknown serial killer using the school’s Red Devil mascot as a disguise.

During his journey, Dan realizes that he’s somehow stuck in an unusual timeline where he can communicate with the woman on the tapes, Melody.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>While American Horror Story and Archive 81 are far from the same on the surface, their premises include bone-chilling scenarios that captivate viewers’ attention. Both shows are equally filled with action-packed situations where main characters have to rely on their courage and unsung need to be the hero. Archive 81 is perfect for those who enjoy a good thriller and solving the plot before it’s been fully revealed. You can watch it now on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Stranger Things</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=622 data-current-count=922 data-injectable=true>You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn’t heard of Netflix’s massive sci-fi hit Stranger Things. Created by the Duffer Brothers, the captivating series debuted in 2018 and immediately received a cauldron of attention and acclaim. The ’80s-inspired series initially follows a group of residents in the small town of Hawkins, Indiana where the recent disappearance of a young boy, Will Byers, kickstarts a string of unusual experiments and otherworldly creatures coming from Hawkins Lab. Over time, the seasons begin to focus on a majority of the characters’ conflicts rather than just Will himself.</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>Like American Horror Story, the drama series focuses on conflicting circumstances for its large string of beloved characters, placing them in situations that sometimes appear inescapable. On the other hand, it’s these colorful characters that make Stranger Things such a glorious television series that will be talked about many years after its unpredictable conclusion. You can watch it now on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Black Mirror</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=742 data-injectable=true>Over the years, Black Mirror has been highly regarded as one of the best television series of the 2010s. Created by Charlie Brooker, the anthology series premiered on Britain’s Channel 4 in 2011 for the first two seasons before eventually ending up on Netflix. The enchanting series provides each season as a stand-alone by focusing on dystopian near-futures and utilizing speculative fiction within the larger landscape of science fiction.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Black Mirror is arguably the most similar series to American Horror Story in terms of its cast being recast as different characters each season with an entirely new narrative for each episode. The show has also featured several popular celebrity guest appearances, including Miley Cyrus, Anthony Mackie, and Jon Hamm. You can watch it now on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Channel Zero</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>Another anthology series quite similar to American Horror Story is Syfy’s Channel Zero. Part of the reason for the series’ popularity is that its storylines are based on notable creepypasta stories that have terrified folks on the internet for years. Created by Nick Antosca, the thought-provoking series premiered in 2016 and ran until 2018 for a total of four gripping seasons. Each one is dedicated to a specific timeline of events derived from creepypasta posts of years past.</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Channel Zero is likely the most similar series to American Horror Story in terms of frightening moments and the basis of presenting it as a horror anthology. Additionally, the show follows a similar premise, much like many others on this list, where each season introduces a new storyline that wholeheartedly terrifies its viewers. More so because Channel Zero includes much less comedic moments than American Horror Story. You can watch it now on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shudder</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>The Twilight Zone</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>The Twilight Zone remains one of the most easily recognizable and iconic horror television series of all time. Created and narrated by Rod Sterling, each episode allows viewers to understand the central characters as they experience unimaginable journeys of sheer terror and unexplainable horror. Each episode is different from the last, but leaves the same unsettling feeling that makes the ’60s series a classic to this day.</p><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=false>For all intents and purposes, The Twilight Zone laid the initial groundwork for all other anthology horror series to follow. Its gripping storylines and lovable twists blend with the bizarre and macabre and made it a staple in the genre of horror for decades. As a result, the series was recently remade by horror-genius Jordan Peele, though it didn’t quite stick with viewers the way the original did ⏤ a reminder that you simply cannot beat the classics, no matter which decade they’re from.
