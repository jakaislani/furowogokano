The former #16 UFC featherweight star amassed many followers through his skilful fighting talent.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to the sources, Swanson was born and raised in <span class=ILfuVd lang=en><span class=hgKElc>Palm Springs, California</span></span>.&nbsp;</span>Reportedly, his father, Steven Swanson, is of Swedish origin, and his mother is Mexican.&nbsp;</p><p>So, he is of mixed origin, having Swedish, Mexican, and American ancestry. Eventually<span data-preserver-spaces=true>, he developed his fighting passion into a career and learnt the fighting discipline.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He still fights out of his hometown in <span class=ILfuVd lang=en><span class=hgKElc>Palm Springs, California</span></span>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As his surname is not common in America, barely any website has associated its ancestry.

His family members were believers in God, and he spent most of his early life in the church.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Likewise, he was homeschooled for most of his childhood.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, Swanson isn’t much invested in publicly revealing his origin and ancestry as he seems more focused on his fighting career. He has settled himself as a threatening opponent in UFC.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While the fighter’s ethnicity and religion may interest his followers, what matters most is talent and hard work to improve his stats further.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Thanks to his constant dedication, Swanson improves regularly even at this age and becomes the man he is today.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Read More:&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Justin Gaethje Tattoo: How Many Body Inks Does He Have?</span></a></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Cub Swanson Family And Married Life</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Swanson’s supporters are keen to learn about the love of his life.
